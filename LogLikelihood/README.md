# Democracy Lab - Log Likelihood
## By: Ryan Schaefer

This folder contains the code for the custom Log Likelihood function I built in C++. I then used Rcpp to make a package in R that contains this function. To install this package, clone this repository, set your working directory in R to this folder, and run the following command in R:

```install.packages("LogLikelihood_1.0.tar.gz", type = "source", repos = NULL)```

Use ```?log_likelihood``` to view the help page for this function to see how to use it.
